<p>Detect to protect: pneumoperitoneum gas samples for SARS-CoV-2 and biohazard testing</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<h1>Main text</h1>

<p>As we walk through a period of uncertainty, it becomes essential to obtain clear, prompt, and evidence-based indications to guide surgeons and protect OR staff. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic profoundly modified the patients’ case load of most surgical units, affecting both the volume and the quality of care: different behaviors have been suggested to regulate surgical and endoscopic activity during the emergency [1–6] and a significant concern has been raised about the possibility of contagion from patients affected by COVID-19 infection during interventional procedures. It is known that surgical smoke and aerosol generated during a surgical procedure can contain viruses, which in some circumstances has led to infection [7–9]; however, no data have demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the smoke generated during a surgical procedure yet. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 non-respiratory transmission is still under investigation. Fecal-oral transmission has also been suggested, while viral clearance modality and its timing are not entirely understood [10–15]. Additional concerns were raised about the risk of infection associated with the use of laparoscopy. It has therefore been suggested to reduce the working pressure during abdominal laparoscopy to a minimum and some have also questioned if laparoscopy should be used at all during the pandemics. National guidelines have indeed advised to consider alternative treatments, whenever possible, underlying the suspect of an increased risk of contamination for laparoscopic procedures due to the aerosol diffusion in the OR environment.</p>

<p>Protection of any care-giver and of the surgical team is and must remain a priority. That involves comprehensive measures aimed to prevent established as well as hypothetical risk [16]. Nonetheless we should in parallel pay our attention to assess the size of the risk, recognize precise modality of viral spread, and study patterns of viral excretion in order to eventually provide our patients the same standard of quality surgery as before. Our practice must be driven by indications which, in turn, should be based on facts. Sampling peritoneal fluid during an open or a laparoscopic procedure is a relatively simple maneuver. However, that not necessarily reflects the size of the risk associated with laparoscopy, due to the related aerosol formation and of its possible diffusion in the OR environment. <span style="background-color:rgb(161,201,244);">The possibility to sample the intraperitoneal gas would provide useful information to better understand the pattern of diffusion of COVID-19 and whether the virus is present in the peritoneal cavity and in the pneumoperitoneum of infected patients.<span style="background-color:rgb(161,201,244);"></p>
