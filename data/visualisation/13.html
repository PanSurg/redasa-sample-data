<h1>Title</h1>

<p>Implementing emergency gynecologic surgery guidelines during COVID-19</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<h1>Main text</h1>

<p>New York City (NYC), the world's COVID epicenter, reached its peak of COVID-19 new cases and deaths in mid-April.1 During the evolution of this crisis, the NYC institutions collaborated to address the challenges facing their health care systems. <span style="background-color:rgb(255,180,130);">The results of such informal and formal meetings to focus on the pandemic resulted in the establishment of universal testing protocols for pregnant patients, the suspension of all non-urgent surgeries, and the conversion of operative units to intensive care units (ICUs). In this letter we share the protocol for the care of patients in need of emergent gynecologic surgery.<span style="background-color:rgb(255,180,130);"></p>

<p>All patients are tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) when a decision for emergency surgery is made. Patients with pending SARS-CoV-2 results are considered a person under investigation (PUI) and are treated as COVID-19 positive. A PUI must wear a surgical mask and all personnel in contact with the PUI require personal protective equipment (PPE). This PPE includes an N95 mask underneath a surgical mask, a face shield or eye goggles, a gown, double gloves, head covering, and shoe covers. There are designated PPE coordinators in each unit to ensure proper distribution of supplies for the safety of staff.</p>

<p>The patient is taken directly from the Emergency Department (ED) to the operating room (OR) because our preoperative hold areas are serving as ICUs. Our institution has two OR's assigned for PUI and COVID-19 positive patients; these rooms are large, and well-ventilated. <span style="background-color:rgb(161,201,244);">Once the patient is in the OR, only the anesthesia team remains in the room for anesthesia induction. Intubations are performed using the assistance of a video laryngoscope while the patient is placed under a clear plastic sheet to reduce viral spread. After intubation, the surgical team returns to the room which is then deemed a restricted zone to minimize all traffic in and out <span style="background-color:rgb(161,201,244);">(Figure 1
).</p>

<p>During the <span style="background-color:rgb(255,180,130);">surgery we follow the Gynecology surgical COVID-19 joint statement by the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL), American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS), International Gynecologic Cancer Society (IGCS), Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO), Society of Gynecologic Surgeons (SGS), and the Canadian Society for the Advancement of Gynecologic Excellence (CanSAGE) which recommends low CO2 insufflation pressures between 10-12 mmHg with use of smoke evacuator systems and gentle release of pneumoperitoneum at completion of procedure during laparoscopy to reduce aerosolization of possible peritoneal SARS-CoV-2.2 This joint statement also addresses laparotomy as well as other gynecologic procedures.<span style="background-color:rgb(255,180,130);"></p>

<p>Extubation is performed while the patient remains sedated to reduce his/her cough reflex. At the conclusion of the procedure the nursing and anesthesia team leave due to staff shortage and redeployment to COVID units as experienced by other institutions as well. Because our post anesthesia care units are also currently ICU's, the patient completes postoperative recovery in the OR while monitored by the surgical team. Once meeting milestones for discharge, he/she is escorted from the OR to the hospital exit by the surgical team to reduce patient exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Figure 1).</p>

<p>COVID-19 pandemic has been a unique time where healthcare workers have come together nationally and internationally, sharing their experiences for patient care. As others continue to see an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases we encourage everyone to look at national and international organizations and large institutional protocols in care of not just COVID-19 patients but all patients in order to assure the safety of patients, and staff.</p>
