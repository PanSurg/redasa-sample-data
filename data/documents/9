Absence of nosocomial transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-pandemic phase in Hong Kong


# Abstract

BACKGROUND: To describe the infection control strategy to achieve zero nosocomial transmission of symptomatic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 during the pre-pandemic phase (the first 72 days after announcement of pneumonia cases in Wuhan) in Hong Kong. METHODS: Administrative support with the aim of zero nosocomial transmission by reducing elective clinical services, decanting wards, mobilizing isolation facilities, providing adequate personal protective equipment, coordinating laboratory network for rapid molecular diagnosis under 4-tier active surveillance for hospitalized- and out-patients, and organizing staff forum and training was implemented under the framework of preparedness plan in Hospital Authority. The trend of SARS-CoV-2 in the first 72 days was compared with that of SARS-CoV 2003. RESULTS: Up to day 72 of the epidemic, 130 (0.40%) of 32,443 patients being screened confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Compared with SARS outbreak in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 case load constituted 8.9% (130 SARS-CoV-2/1458 SARS-CoV) of SARS-CoV infected cases at day 72 of the outbreak. The incidences of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV per-1,000-SARS-patient-day and per-100-SARS-patient-admission were 7.9 and 16.9 respectively, which were significantly higher than the corresponding incidences of SARS-CoV-2 (zero infection, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Administrative support to infection control could minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.


# Main text

Pandemic infection of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020, which is 72 days after announcement of a cluster of patients with community acquired pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHCPRC), on 31 December 2019 (day 1)1. On day 72, the COVID-19 had already spread to 113 countries or territories in five continents, resulting in 118,319 confirmed cases all over the world2. While the epidemic of COVID-19 is slowing down in China, there is active community transmission in Europe and North America, resulting in 30% of disease burden is outside China2. Overwhelming number of COVID-19 infections could not only paralyze the healthcare system, but more importantly, result in nosocomial outbreak, associated with increased morbidity and mortality of the hospitalized patients and healthcare workers (HCWs). Up to 24 February 2020 (day 56), NHCPRC reported that 3,387 healthcare workers were infected with COVID-19, resulting in 22 (0.6%) deaths3. This has exceeded the number of HCWs death due SARS in mainland China after 6 months in 20034. In Hong Kong, eight HCWs succumbed as a result of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV5. The top priority of our pandemic preparedness is to achieve zero COVID-19 infection among HCWs in Hong Kong.

Here, we report our infection control strategy and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the first 72 days (from the official announcement of pneumonia by NHCPRC to the declaration of pandemic infection by WHO), using the historical data on the epidemiology of SARS-CoV in Hong Kong for comparison.

After the outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, a total of 1755 persons were infected and 299 persons (17.0%) died6. Of 386 healthcare workers (HCWs) infected with SARS-CoV in Hong Kong, 8 of them (2.2%) succumbed. Six HCWs (2 doctors, 1 nurse, and 3 healthcare assistants) of 8 were the employee of Hospital Authority, the governing body of all 43 public hospitals, divided into 7 cluster-networks, responsible for 90% of inpatient service in Hong Kong. A “Select Committee to inquire into the handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak by the Government and the Hospital Authority” was established by the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China to in order to examine the performance and accountability of the Government and Hospital Authority and their officers at policy-making and management levels7. The report includes temporal sequence of events and daily statistics on SARS patients with breakdown by healthcare workers and patients. The information is retrieved for analyzing the epidemiology of SARS in 20038. When a novel coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 emerged 17 years later, Hospital Authority immediately activated our response plan to combat the epidemic and to prevent nosocomial transmission and outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. The clinical perspective of infection control measures was reported recently9. The epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 until 11 March 2020 (at day 72 after the official announcement of a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, by NHCPRC in Hong Kong) was analyzed. This is also the date when WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results were compared with the epidemiological data of SARS-CoV at day 72 (11 April 2003) after the official announcement of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province, China on 11 February 2003. In addition, we also compared the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong with Hubei Province, China, which is the most severe affected region by SARS-CoV-2, and the other countries or areas with uncontrolled local transmission at day 72, including Republic of Korea, Islamic Republic of Iran, and Italy, using the publicly accessible information from the WHO website10.

After the SARS outbreak in 2003, a preparedness plan for emerging infectious diseases, including pandemic influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus, was formulated under the governance of Hospital Authority. The preparedness plan to combat against SARS-CoV-2 is basically referring to the framework of these plans. According to the risk assessment, the response levels can be categorized into alert level, serious response level 1 (S1), serious response level 2 (S2), and emergency response level11. The command structure depends on the different response levels (Figure 1
). In the alert and S1 level, the response plan is coordinated by ad hoc Central Committee on Infectious Disease and Emergency Responses (ad hoc CCIDER). In the S2 and emergency response level, the governance will be under the command of Central Command Committee, which is chaired by Chief Executive of Hospital Authority, or Emergency Executive Committee, which is chaired by Chairman of Hospital Authority. The response measures at each response level comprises of a series of action, including active surveillance and electronic notification, laboratory network for rapid molecular diagnostic, infection control measures, provision of essential medical services, facility management in the hospital, human resources and staff deployment, staff training, research, and communication. Contact tracing for potential secondary cases was performed to investigate for any possible nosocomial infection as reported previously12

Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal aspirates, nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swab, saliva, sputum, endotracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage were subjected to nucleic acid extraction by the eMAG extraction system (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile France) as previously described9
,
11. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the specimens was first determined by the LightMix Modular SebeccoV E-gene commercial kit (TIB Molbiol, Berlin, Germany) and further confirmed by another in-house real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase/helicase gene14.

The Fisher's exact test was used to compare independent categorical variables between groups. All reported p values were two-sided. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Computation was performed using the SPSS Version 15.0 for Windows.

Up to 11 March 2020 (day 72 after the official announcement of a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, a total of 130 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were confirmed in Hong Kong, while the first 42 patients were reported previously9. With these additional cases, there were 63 males and 67 females with a median age of 60 years (range 16 - 96 years). The 130 confirmed cases belonged to 22 clusters, of which 8 clusters could be traced from an index patients who had travel history within 14 days of symptoms onset (Figure 2
). The first local case of SARS-CoV-2 occurred on day 31, while the onset of 2003 SARS-CoV was also detected on day 31, which occurred as a nosocomial outbreak affecting 39 HCWs in Hong Kong (Figure 3
). In the first 72 days, the number of infected patients (n=130) with SARS-CoV-2 was 11 times lower than that of SARS-CoV (n=1,458) according to the day-by-day comparison (Figure 3). While the number of infected HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 remained zero on day 72 of 2020, 335 HCWs were infected with SARS-CoV on day 72 in 2003. At the end of the outbreak of 2003 SARS-CoV, 386 HCWs were infected with SARS. 293 (75.9%) of them were investigated for nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV in 8 acute hospitals15. The incidences of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV per 1,000 SARS-patient-day and per 100 SARS-patient-admission were 7.9 and 16.9 respectively, which were significantly higher than the corresponding incidences of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.001).

In the first 72 days, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong was 0.16 per 10,000 populations, which was lower than China (Hubei province), Europe (Italy), Asia (Republic of Korea, and Singapore), and Middle East (Iran) (Table 1
).

Upon receiving the official announcement of a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, on 31 December 2020 (day 1), the infection control responses were stepped up by Hospital Authority according to the rapidly evolving epidemiology in Hong Kong9. The level of response towards emerging infectious disease was directly elevated from alert to S2 on day 5. Ad hoc CCIDER was regularly held among infection control professionals in 7 cluster-networks and senior management team in the head office of Hospital Authority (HAHO) to review and update the infection control responses so as to disseminate the information to the frontline staff via open staff forum, department visit, right-on-time training of gowning and degowning of personal protective equipment (PPE). Upon receiving the first imported case of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong on day 22, the response level was further elevated to the emergency level on day 26. The Central Command Committee (CCC) composed of the top management team of 7 cluster-networks and HAHO is responsible for the decision for various administrative supports in consultation with ad hoc CCIDER which is responsible for professional advice. Up to day 72, a total of 16 meetings of ad hoc CCIDER were held once every 5 days on average, especially focusing on the evolution of infection control recommendations issued by World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, as well as the scientific evidences published during the evolution of epidemic. CCC was held daily since the activation of emergency level. Hospital Authority has set the priority of service to support the infection control and clinical management against SARS-CoV-2. The elective and non-essential clinical services were trimmed down to reduce the bed occupancies in the hospital. Visitors were prohibited to the hospitals except for compassionate reasons. The utilization of airborne infection isolation room (AIIRs) of 1400 beds in the Hong Kong was closely monitored. The first 20 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 would be admitted to a designated hospital. Subsequently, each cluster-network is required to take care of the next 20 confirmed cases. The major incident control centre of HAHO is responsible for cross cluster-network transfer of confirmed cases. Procurement, distribution, and monitor the utilization of PPE and laboratory reagents for rapid molecular diagnostic among 7 cluster-networks were performed by HAHO and hospital management teams. Accommodation is provided to staffs who are working in high risk areas and isolation facilities during the period of emergency response level.

A 4-tier active surveillance for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 was implemented for patients upon admission (tier 1 to 3)9, while the tier 4 surveillance was initiated for patients attending outpatient clinics as well as accident and emergency department since 20 February 2020 (day 52) (Table 2
). From day 1 to day 72, 119 (0.47%) of 25,097 patients fulfilling tier 1 to 3 were confirmed, while between day 52 and 72, eleven (0.15%) of 7,346 out-patients were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Infection of healthcare workers due to occupational exposure to infectious diseases is always a great challenge to hospital administration and infection control professionals. Sporadic cases of occupation related infection among HCWs due to various infectious diseases such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus were occasionally reported16. However, the impact of SARS transmission among HCWs was unprecedentedly high. According to WHO, HCWs accounted for 1,707 (21%) of 8,098 cases of SARS patients in 20036. It produced a significant psychosocial effects and long-term psychological effects on HCWs17. Therefore, when the COVD-19 emerged, it is important to maximize our administrative resources and infection control measures to protect our HCWs, which is particularly relevant in Hong Kong as we had 8 HCWs died in 2003 as a result of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV5

Administrative support to infection control is important to prevent nosocomial outbreak but it is not well studied in recent years19. However, suboptimal administrative support was attributed to the prolonged outbreak of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary care hospital in France20, as well as the major outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong7. Therefore, the command structure for preparedness of emerging infectious diseases was established in Hospital Authority in Hong Kong after outbreak of SARS. Through the regular meetings between the hospital representative of infection control professionals and senior hospital administrators, infection control policy could be timely revised and endorsed by all hospitals under the governance of Hospital Authority. For instance, the clinical and epidemiological criteria for active surveillance of suspected case of COVID-19 was serially updated along with the evolving epidemic of COVID-199.

With the support of hospital administration, the infrastructure of hospitals was improved from the period of SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 by the provision of 1400 AIIRs in Hong Kong. Early isolation of patients with SARS-CoV and their close contacts was found to be effective in termination of chain of transmission5
,
18 when the viral load SARS was peaked at day 10 after symptoms onset5. For SARS-CoV-2, high viral load was detected soon after onset of symptoms onset21. Therefore, 109 of 130 confirmed cases in our series belong to 22 households or social gathering clusters. It is even more important to perform rapid molecular diagnostic test and isolate patients with SARS-CoV-2 as early as possible. It is the reason why we further extended the scope of active surveillance from hospitalized patients to outpatients who have relatively mild respiratory symptoms, and continue contact tracing for potential secondary cases in order to identify any transmission in hospital and community. Business service department of Hospital Authority plays a key role to secure the timely procurement of diagnostic platforms and reagents, as well as PPE for HCWs because global shortage of PPE becomes strategically important in the pandemic of COVID-19.

Major incident control centre of Hospital Authority coordinates the utilization of isolation facilities by cross hospital transferal of confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 across different public hospitals in order to avoid an individual hospital being overwhelmed by confirmed cases. Temporal conversion of general wards to AIIRs was conducted to accommodate the increasing number of patients with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, non-emergency clinical services were trimmed down in order to reduce the bed occupancy and improve the manpower ratio of HCWs to patients, which may facilitate the control of outbreak. No visiting policy during emergency response level in Hospital Authority may further reduce the risk of importation of patients with SARS-CoV-2 from the community. Decanting of wards and deployment of HCWs to care for patients with SARS-CoV-2 were planned in advance. As working in an unfamiliar environment and lapses in infection control were attributed to the nosocomial outbreak of SARS22, the deployed HCWs other than the discipline of internal medicine would be oriented for the logistic of patients’ management in the isolation wards and trained for the use of PPE well before managing suspected and confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2. Note that inappropriate removal of PPE may increase the risk of acquisition of SARS-CoV23.

Ongoing staff forum and training sessions for PPE are regularly conducted to enhance the alertness of HCWs. During the community outbreak of pandemic influenza A, provision of timely education to the staff was one of the important parameters to achieve zero nosocomial outbreak of pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus in 200912. The training materials were compiled into a communication kits which is uploaded to the electronic platform of Hospital Authority with free access to all staff. The health promotion messages to HCWs are further promulgated via social media such as Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp group.

From the declaration of pandemic (day 72) to the time of manuscript submission on 24 March 2020 (day 85), the number of global confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 has nearly tripled (from 118,000 to 332,000). Almost 4,824 HCWs infected with 24 deaths in Italy24. In mainland China, it was shown that 29% (40 of 138) of admitted SARS-CoV-2 patients in Zhongnan hospital, Wuhan were HCWs25. This proves the high risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On day 85, the number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 was over 300 in Hong Kong while zero transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs and hospitalized patients could be maintained in Hong Kong for almost 3 months, suggestive of a significant improvement in the healthcare infrastructure to combat against emerging infectious diseases in Hong Kong.
